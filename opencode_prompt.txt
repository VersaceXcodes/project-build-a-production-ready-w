UI-only redesign: update ONLY the Landing Page HERO section to a premium modern look.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change any backend or data fetching.
- Do NOT change component behavior or handlers.
- Reuse the existing hero component and its current CTA buttons and links.
- Do NOT add new routes.

Hero UI requirements:
- Premium dark gradient background (subtle, high-end).
- Add a small top tag line above the headline:
  “PREMIUM PRINT & BRANDING SOLUTIONS”
- Headline style: bold modern typography similar to premium references.
  Suggested headline:
  “Personalise First, Deliver Excellence”
  (you may adjust wording, but keep it short and premium)
- Subheadline stays similar meaning to current.
- Keep 2 CTAs:
  Primary button (same handler as current “Get a Quote”): label “Get Your Custom Quote”
  Secondary button (same handler as current “View Gallery”/gallery link): label “View Our Portfolio”
- Improve spacing, alignment, and responsiveness (mobile-first).
- Do not modify anything outside the hero section.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "UI-only redesign: update ONLY the Landing Page HERO section to a premium modern look.
