You are a senior frontend engineer debugging a MOBILE NAVIGATION BUG.

CONTEXT:
- This is a mobile-first responsive website.
- There is a hamburger menu (3-line icon) on mobile.
- When the user taps the hamburger icon, NOTHING happens.
- No sidebar, drawer, or menu becomes visible.
- This is a critical UX bug.

YOUR TASK:
Identify the root cause and FIX the mobile sidebar so it opens and closes correctly on tap, with proper animations, accessibility, and state handling.

--------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
--------------------------------------------

1) FUNCTIONALITY
- Tapping the hamburger icon MUST open a mobile sidebar / drawer.
- Tapping again OR tapping outside the drawer MUST close it.
- Sidebar must slide in smoothly (left or right).
- State must persist correctly during navigation.
- Must work on real mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome).

2) STATE MANAGEMENT
- Use explicit state (e.g. `isMenuOpen`).
- Hamburger button toggles this state.
- Sidebar visibility MUST depend ONLY on this state.
- No CSS-only hover hacks.

3) COMMON BUGS TO CHECK AND FIX
You MUST verify and fix any of the following if present:
- Missing `onClick` handler on hamburger button
- `pointer-events: none` on the button or overlay
- Sidebar rendered but hidden via `display: none` with no toggle
- Sidebar mounted outside React tree or behind z-index
- `z-index` lower than header or hero section
- Overflow hidden on body blocking interaction
- Event handler attached to wrong element
- Mobile breakpoint hiding the sidebar entirely
- Sidebar component never mounted

4) ACCESSIBILITY
- Hamburger button MUST be a `<button>` element (not a div).
- Add `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`.
- Sidebar must trap focus when open.
- Escape key closes the menu.
- Screen-reader friendly.

5) MOBILE UX
- Sidebar covers 70–85% of screen width.
- Background page is dimmed with an overlay.
- Scrolling of body is disabled when menu is open.
- Tap targets ≥ 44px.
- Sidebar scrolls independently if content overflows.

--------------------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION SPEC
--------------------------------------------

A) HAMBURGER BUTTON
- Must have:
  - onClick toggle
  - visible hit area
  - high z-index
- Example behavior:
  - click → open menu
  - click again → close menu

B) SIDEBAR / DRAWER
- Position: fixed
- Top: 0
- Height: 100vh
- Transform-based animation:
  - closed: translateX(-100%) OR translateX(100%)
  - open: translateX(0)
- Transition: 250–300ms ease-out
- Z-index ABOVE header + hero

C) OVERLAY
- Semi-transparent black overlay behind sidebar
- Clicking overlay closes sidebar

D) BODY SCROLL LOCK
- When sidebar is open:
  - `document.body.style.overflow = "hidden"`
- When closed:
  - restore original overflow

--------------------------------------------
DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------
Before writing the fix, do ALL of the following:
1) Confirm whether the click event is firing (console log).
2) Confirm sidebar component is rendered in DOM.
3) Confirm computed styles when menu should be open.
4) Verify z-index stacking context.
5) Verify mobile breakpoint logic.

Then implement the FIX.

--------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
--------------------------------------------
- Provide the corrected component code (React/Next.js friendly).
- Show:
  - hamburger button
  - sidebar
  - overlay
  - state logic
- Code must be production-ready.
- Explain briefly WHAT was broken and WHY it didn’t open.

ASSUME:
- Tailwind CSS is available.
- React / Next.js App Router environment.
- Mobile-first design.

FIX THE BUG COMPLETELY.

When the user mentions generic pages, map them to concrete files/components by scanning for headings and routes. Examples you MUST follow:
- If the user says "login" or "sign in", search for components containing the literal heading "Sign in to your account" and edit that file.
- If the user says "sign up" or "register", search for "Create your account" or equivalent.
- Always return an explicit list of changed file paths. If your first attempt doesn't change the UI, re-search by heading text and update the correct file.

⚠️ PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS:
- The user's request above is the PRIMARY task. Complete it first.
- Ignore any existing errors, warnings, or issues you detect in the project unless they directly prevent you from completing the user's requested task.
- Do NOT automatically fix unrelated errors or refactor code unless explicitly requested.
- Focus solely on implementing the user's request: "You are a senior frontend engineer debugging a MOBILE NAVIGATION BUG.
